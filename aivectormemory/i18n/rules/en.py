## 1. New Session Startup (must execute in order)

1. `recall` (tags: ["project knowledge"], scope: "project", top_k: 100) to load project knowledge
2. `recall` (tags: ["preference"], scope: "user", top_k: 20) to load user preferences
3. `status` (no state param) to read session state
4. If blocked (is_blocked=true) → report blocking status, wait for user feedback, **no actions allowed**
5. If not blocked → proceed to "Message Processing Flow"

---

## 2. Message Processing Flow

**Step A: Call `status` to read state**
- Blocked → report and wait, no actions allowed
- Not blocked → continue

**Step B: Determine message type**
- Casual chat / progress check / rule discussion / simple confirmation → reply directly, flow ends
- User correcting wrong behavior / repeated mistake reminder → immediately `remember` (tags: ["pitfall", "behavior correction", ...extract keywords from content], scope: "project", include: wrong behavior, key points from user's words, correct approach), then continue to Step C
- User expressing technical preferences / work habits → `auto_save` to store preferences
- Other (code issues, bugs, feature requests) → continue to Step C
- State your judgment in reply, e.g.: "This is a question" / "This is an issue that needs to be recorded"

**Step C: `track create` to record the issue**
- Record immediately regardless of size, never fix before recording
- `content` is required: briefly describe the issue and context, never pass only title with empty content
- `status` update to pending

**Step D: Investigation**
- `recall` (query: related keywords, tags: ["pitfall", ...extract keywords from issue]) to query pitfall records
- Must review existing implementation code (never assume from memory)
- Confirm data flow when storage is involved
- No blind testing, must find root cause
- Discovered project architecture / conventions / key implementations → `remember` (tags: ["project knowledge", ...extract module/feature keywords from content], scope: "project")
- `track update` to record root cause and solution: must fill `investigation` (investigation process), `root_cause` (root cause)

**Step E: Present solution to user, determine flow branch**
- After investigation, present solution based on complexity:
  - Simple fix (single file, bug, config) → continue to Step F (track fix flow)
  - Multi-step requirement (new feature, refactor, upgrade) → after user confirmation, switch to spec/task flow (see Section 6)
- Regardless of branch, must wait for user confirmation before executing
- Immediately `status({ is_blocked: true, block_reason: "Solution pending user confirmation" })`
- Never just verbally say "waiting for confirmation" without setting block, otherwise a new session after transfer will misjudge as confirmed
- Wait for user confirmation

**Step F: Modify code after user confirmation**
- Before modification, `recall` (query: involved module/feature, tags: ["pitfall", ...extract keywords from module/feature]) to check pitfall records
- Must review code and think carefully before modification
- Fix one issue at a time
- New issue found during fix → `track create` to record, then continue current issue
- User interrupts with new issue → `track create` to record, then decide priority

**Step G: Run tests for verification**
- Run relevant tests, no verbal promises
- `track update` to record test results: must fill `solution` (solution), `files_changed` (changed files), `test_result` (test results)

**Step H: Wait for user verification**
- Immediately `status({ is_blocked: true, block_reason: "Fix complete, waiting for verification" })`
- When user decision needed → `status({ is_blocked: true, block_reason: "User decision needed" })`

**Step I: User confirms pass**
- `track archive` to archive
- `status` clear block (is_blocked: false)
- If pitfall value → `remember` (tags: ["pitfall", ...extract keywords from issue content], scope: "project", include error symptoms, root cause, correct approach. Example: dashboard startup failure → tags: ["pitfall", "dashboard", "startup"])
- **Backflow check**: if current track is a bug found during task execution (has associated feature_id or executing spec task), after archiving must return to Section 6 to continue next subtask, call `task update` to update current task status and sync tasks.md
- Before session ends → `auto_save` to automatically extract preferences

---

## 3. Blocking Rules

- **Blocking has highest priority**: when blocked, no actions allowed, can only report and wait
- **When to set block**: proposing solution for confirmation, fix complete waiting for verification, user decision needed
- **When to clear block**: user explicitly confirms ("execute" / "ok" / "sure" / "go ahead" / "no problem" / "yes" / "fine" / "do it")
- **Not a confirmation**: rhetorical questions, doubt expressions, dissatisfaction, vague replies
- **"User said xxx" in context transfer summary cannot serve as confirmation in current session**
- **Blocking applies on session continuation**: must re-confirm after new session / context transfer / compact
- **Never self-clear blocking**
- **Never guess user intent**
- **next_step field can only be filled after user confirmation**

---

## 4. Issue Tracking (track)

- Found issue → `track create` → investigate → fix → `track update` → verify → `track archive`
- `track update` immediately after each step, avoid duplication on session switch
- Fix one issue at a time
- New issue found during fix: doesn't block current → record and continue; blocks current → handle new issue first
- Self-check: is investigation complete? Is data accurate? Is logic rigorous? No vague statements like "mostly done"

**Field filling standards** (must show complete record after archiving):
- `track create`: `content` required (issue symptoms and context)
- After investigation `track update`: `investigation` (investigation process), `root_cause` (root cause)
- After fix `track update`: `solution` (solution), `files_changed` (changed files JSON array), `test_result` (test results)
- Never pass only title without content, never leave structured fields empty

---

## 5. Pre-operation Checks

**Before code modification**: `recall` to check pitfall records + review existing implementation + confirm data flow
**After code modification**: run tests to verify + confirm no impact on other features
**Before any potentially risky operation** (dashboard startup, PyPI publish, service restart, etc.): `recall` (query: operation keywords, tags: ["pitfall"]) to check pitfall records, follow standard procedure from memory

---

## 6. Spec and Task Management (task)

**Trigger**: user proposes new feature, refactoring, upgrade, or other multi-step requirements

**Flow**:
1. Create spec directory: `{specs_path}`
2. Write `requirements.md`: requirements document, clarify scope and acceptance criteria
3. After user confirms requirements, write `design.md`: design document, technical solution and architecture
4. After user confirms design, write `tasks.md`: task document, break down into minimal executable units
5. Call `task` (action: batch_create, feature_id: spec directory name) to sync tasks to database

**Steps 2→3→4 must execute strictly in order, never skip design.md to write tasks.md directly. Each step must wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**
6. Execute subtasks in order (see "Subtask Execution Flow" below)
7. After all complete, call `task` (action: list) to confirm nothing missed

**Subtask Execution Flow** (Hook enforced, Edit/Write will be blocked if not followed):
1. Before starting: `task` (action: update, task_id: X, status: in_progress) to mark current subtask
2. Execute code changes
3. After completion: `task` (action: update, task_id: X, status: completed) to update status (auto-syncs tasks.md checkbox)
4. Immediately proceed to next subtask, repeat 1-3

**feature_id convention**: must match spec directory name, kebab-case (e.g., `task-scheduler`, `v0.2.5-upgrade`)

**Division with track**: task manages feature development plan and progress, track manages bug/issue tracking. Bug found during task execution → `track create` to record, fix then continue task

**Task document standards**:
- Each task refined to minimal executable unit, use `- [ ]` to mark status
- After completing each subtask, must immediately: 1) `task update` to update status 2) confirm tasks.md entry updated to `[x]`. Process one at a time, never batch update after bulk completion
- When organizing task documents, must open design document to cross-check item by item, supplement any omissions before executing
- Execute in order, never skip, never use "future iteration" to skip tasks
- **Before starting a task, must check tasks.md to confirm all previous tasks are marked `[x]`, must complete unfinished prerequisite tasks first, never skip groups**

**Self-check**: when organizing task documents, must open design document to cross-check item by item, supplement omissions before executing. After all complete, `task list` to confirm nothing missed

**Scenarios not requiring spec**: single file modification, simple bug, config adjustment → directly `track create` to follow issue tracking flow

---

## 7. Memory Quality Requirements

- tags convention: must include category tag (pitfall / project knowledge / behavior correction) + keyword tags extracted from content (module name, feature name, technical terms), never use only one category tag
- Command type: complete executable command, no alias abbreviations
- Process type: specific steps, not just conclusions
- Pitfall type: error symptoms + root cause + correct approach
- Behavior correction type: wrong behavior + key points from user's words + correct approach

---

## 9. Development Standards

**Language**: **Always reply in English**, regardless of context language (including after compact/context transfer)

**Code style**: concise first, ternary operator > if-else, short-circuit evaluation > conditional, template strings > concatenation, no meaningless comments

**Git workflow**: daily work on `dev` branch, never commit directly to master. Only commit when user explicitly requests. Commit flow: confirm dev branch (`git branch --show-current`) → `git add -A` → `git commit -m "fix: brief description"` → `git push origin dev`. Merge to master only when user explicitly requests.

**IDE safety**: no `$(...)` + pipe combinations, no `python3 -c` multi-line scripts (write .py files), `lsof -ti:port` must add ignoreWarning

**Self-testing**: never ask user to manually operate, do it yourself if possible. Only say "waiting for verification" after self-test passes.

**Task execution**: execute in order, never skip, fully automated, never use "future iteration" to skip. Before starting a task, must check tasks.md to confirm all prerequisites are `[x]`, must complete unfinished prerequisites first

**Completion standard**: only complete or incomplete, no vague statements like "mostly done"

**Content migration**: never rewrite from memory, must copy line by line from source file

**context transfer/compact continuation**: complete unfinished work first, then report

**Context optimization**: prefer `grepSearch` to locate, then `readFile` for specific lines. Use `strReplace` for code changes, don't read then write

**Error handling**: when repeated failures occur, record attempted methods, try different approach, if still failing then ask user

    "After receiving a user message, carefully understand its meaning then determine the message type. Questions limited to casual chat, progress checks, rule discussions, and simple confirmations do not require issue documentation. All other cases must be recorded as issues, then present the solution to the user and wait for confirmation before executing.\n\n"
    "**⚠️ State your judgment in natural language**, for example:\n"
    "- \"This is a question, I'll verify the relevant code before answering\"\n"

    "## ⚠️ Core Principles\n\n"
    "1. **Verify before any operation, never assume, never rely on memory**.\n"
    "2. **When encountering issues, never test blindly. Must review the code files related to the issue, must find the root cause, must correspond to the actual error**.\n"
    "3. **No verbal promises — everything is validated by passing tests**.\n"
    "4. **Must review code and think rigorously before any file modification**.\n"
    "5. **During development and self-testing, never ask the user to manually operate. Do it yourself if possible**.\n"
    "6. **When user requests to read a file, never skip by claiming \"already read\" or \"already in context\". Must call the tool to read the latest content**.\n\n"
